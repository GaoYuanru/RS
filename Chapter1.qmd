## Summary

In the first week I learned about some common remote sensing data and applications from the course, as well as gained an initial understanding of remote sensing. I also learnt about basic concepts related to remote sensing such as sensors and electric waves. One of the things I felt most strongly about was the process of how remote sensing works. Active and passive remote sensing

Considered how electromagnetic waves interact with

Earth's surface Atmosphere Explored the 4 resolutions of remotely sensed data

Spectral Spatial Temporal Radiometric Identified how constraints (environmental or sensor) can dictate the choice of data we use.

### The two types of sensor

#### Active remote sensing content and example

Active sensors have their own source of light or illumination. In particular, it actively sends a pulse and measures the backscatter reflected to the sensor.Active remote sensing comes in many forms. For example, they can be satellites orbiting the Earth, helicopters in the air, or anything on the ground too. Just as long as it has an active sensor.For the untrained eye, it's just a bunch of black and white pixels. But the reality is that there's more than meets the eye. For example, the 3 main types of backscatter are:

-   Specular reflection:Specular reflection is where dark spots are in the image. In this case, it's the smooth surfaces like the east-west flowing river and paved surfaces.

-   Double-bounce:Specular reflection is where dark spots are in the image. In this case, it's the smooth surfaces like the east-west flowing river and paved surfaces.

-   Diffuse scattering:Finally, the majority of the radar image is rough surface and diffuse scattering. This may be from the growing vegetation in the agricultural areas. Passive remote sensing example

    #### Passive remote sensing content and example

    Passive sensors use naturally emitted light from the sun. Without the sun, there wouldn't be passive remote sensing. Really, passive remote sensing can be very similar to how our eyes interpret the world. For example, here are the Rocky Mountains in true color.But the power of passive remote sensing is to see light in the whole electromagnetic spectrum. For example, this multispectral image can have different band combinations like color infrared.

  B --> F(Spectral resolution refers to the specific wavelength intervals in the Electromagnetic spectrum that a sensor can record.)
  C --> G(Spatial resolution is a measure of the smallest object that can be resolved by the sensor, or the area on the ground represented by each pixel.)
  D --> H(Temporal resolution refers to how often a sensor obtains imagery of a particular area.)
  E --> I(Radiometric resolution refers to the dynamic range, or number of possible data file values in each band. )

## Applications

## Reflection

Why does the moon have a black sky? Why is the ocean (usually) blue?
