## About Yuanru Gao

{{< video https://youtu.be/K4HA1PC55SM >}} My name is Yuanru Gao. I obtained a bachelorâ€™s degree in Geographic Information Science in China in 2022. My areas of interest are WebGIS and indoor navigation. During my undergraduate studies, I was awarded a professional patented software copyright for Jinan Wisdom Spring System for Tourism V1.0. I am now studying Urban Spatial Science at University College London to pursue my dream as a spatial science researcher. As you see above, I am also a dancer and actress. In my spare time, I would like to go to take a dance video as long as I have new inspiration.
